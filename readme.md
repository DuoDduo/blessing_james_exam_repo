## Question 1 
This involves writing a programme for a basic calculator function with continuous use
The function covers: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division function.

The program repeatedly allows the user to perform operations until they choose to exit.

Program flow: 
- Display welcome message and calculator menu to the user
- Ask them to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
- Ask the user to enter two numbers.

I used functions to define each operation.
I used try-except to handle invalid input and division by zero.
I used control flow (if-elif-else) to validate selection of correct calculator operation.
I used a while loop to keep running until the user chooses to exit.

## Question 2
This involves completing a partially writtten code
I completed the missing parts of the program so that it keeps asking the user for a number and tells whether it is even or odd.

The code involving using input, int conversion, if-else control flow, and print output now works  perfectly in the programme
The while loop now runs until the user types 'exit'.

## Question 3

This involves debugging an incorrect code
- I identified and fix the errors which is validating the user input by typecasting to int
-I refactored the try except block to catch invalid input
